**`Junior Frontend Developer`**

I started my journey with coding in 2021/2022. My father needed a website for his local company so I volontured for that. Having absolutely no idea about web development I tackled for a while with this as a side project and after some time shipped the first version of the website. I started coding because I needed that for something specific. I soon realized that programming can be very powerful in providing tools to solve practically every problem. Since then I dedicate almost every ounce of my free time to expand my programming skills, mainly with projects that I want to use myself.
